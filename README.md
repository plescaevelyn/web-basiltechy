# web-basiltechy

The repo used by the BasilTechy team and the management of the team at the iTEC hackathon organized in 2022 by Liga AC, Universitatea Politehnica din Timisoara.
We participated at the web section of the hackathon and got into the semifinals. This is the first website both of us have ever created :)

# Theme

The theme of the website that we created is travel, therefore we created a travel website. 
It includes an index (main) page, an About Us page, a Contact page and a Covid-19 page that has some codes regarding the tests, because this hackathon was held in the middle of the Covid 19 pandemic, when we needed to get some tests done before travelling :). 

# Technologies

We used HTML, CSS and JS in order to create this website. As it was both of our first website, we used a template that we found online.
